# TensorFlow_Cert_Development
Consolodating all of the material I learned into a comprehensive understanding of the various ways of importing and processing data. This is my main struggle as the understanding behind the models of NLP, CV, and Time Series are already well engrained in me.

# Set up
A simple pipenv will allow this to work perfectly. I have also made this work with anaconda; however, tensorflow=='2.13' seems to have some difficulty resolving in conda.

I am also using python 3.9.2 which can be installed [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/).
